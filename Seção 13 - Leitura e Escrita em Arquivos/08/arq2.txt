FADE INTO YOU
I WANT TO HOLD THE HAND INSIDE YOU
I WANT TO TAKE A BREATH THAT'S TRUE
I LOOK TO YOU AND I SEE NOTHING
I LOOK TO YOU TO SEE THE TRUTH

YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
YOU GO IN SHADOWS
YOU'LL COME APART AND YOU'LL GO BLIND
SOME KIND OF NIGHT INTO YOUR DARKNESS
COLORS YOUR EYES WITH WHAT'S NOT THERE

FADE INTO YOU
STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW
FADE INTO YOU
I THINK IT'S STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW

A STRANGER'S LIGHT COMES ON SLOWLY
A STRANGER'S HEART WITHOUT A HOME
YOU PUT YOUR HANDS INTO YOUR HEAD
AND THEN SMILES COVER YOUR HEART

FADE INTO YOU
STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW
FADE INTO YOU
I THINK IT'S STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW

FADE INTO YOU
STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW
FADE INTO YOU
I THINK IT'S STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW
I THINK IT'S STRANGE YOU NEVER KNEW
